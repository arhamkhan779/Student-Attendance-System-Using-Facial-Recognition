Welcome to the **AI-Based Student Attendance System**! This project leverages facial recognition technology to streamline student attendance management, ensuring a hassle-free experience for educators and parents alike.

## 📚 Project Overview

The system consists of three main functionalities:

1. **Student Registration**:
   - New students can be registered using OpenCV.
   - Data is stored in JSON format, ensuring easy management and retrieval.
   - Upon successful registration, an email notification is sent to the student's parents.

2. **Attendance Tracking**:
   - The attendance of registered students is marked automatically when their faces are detected.
   - Utilizes Python’s Face Recognition API for accurate identification.
   - Attendance confirmation is sent via email to the parents.

3. **Final Report Generation**:
   - Generates attendance reports based on student ID.
   - Reports can be emailed to parents for their records.
